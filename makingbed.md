# Bed making - A beginners Guide
## Introduction
After a good night's sleep, the last thing a person would want to do is to delay coffee intake by turning around before leaving the bedroom spending untold seconds remaking what has already been made a day, week, or month before. Yet, when the bedroom is revisited at night, the unmade bed can introduce unwanted delays before the desired blanket and pillow poistioning is achieved. It is for this reason that I have decided to create this quick tutorial, which is designed to facilitate efficient bedroom exit in the morining, as well as sheet entry in the evening.
## Procedures
### Pillow
Returning the pillow to its optimal location upon wake-up can be the most crucial componant of an effortless return to the arms of Morpheus the follwing evening. To return the pillow:
1. Grab hold of both sides of the pillow
2. Lift the pillow off the bed.
	*Pushing or sliding the pillow mar result in pillowcase creases*
3. Place the pillow at the exact spot that is preferred upon evening bed re-entry.
### Duvet
*This guide only deals with duvet replacement. Blanket and flat sheet configurations have been deemed unacceptable by the **International Bed Making Association's 1947 convention proceedings**, and have been deemed acceptable only in government hospitals, mental institutions, and some sleep-away camps*
1. With both hands, grab the foot-side corners of the duvet.
2. Shake vigorously with a whipping motion towards the pillow side of the bed. This operation is designed to straighten out the blanket that is present within the duvet cover.
3. Repeat step 2.
4. Repeat step 2 again, but gently, allowing the duvet to rest evenly over the bed, with the top of the duvet lightly touching the front edge of the pillow.
